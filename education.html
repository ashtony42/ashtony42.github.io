                            <p>Ohio's education funding formula was <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/DeRolph_v._State_of_Ohio">ruled unconstitutional in 1997</a> and despite the Ohio Supreme Court's deadline of one year to replace it, our state legislature has yet to do so.</p>

                            <p>By relying so heavily on property taxes to fund schools, our students' quality of education and successes into adulthood can accurately be predicted <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://apnews.com/article/1d856cd98d4c491e8443576b3a817740">based off of their zip code</a>.

                            <p><a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://broadbandnow.com/Ohio">1.1 million</a> Ohioans have access to only one or zero high-speed internet providers, and the pandemic has demonstrated that access to the internet is key for the educational process.

                            <p>The average cost of sending a child to preschool in Ohio is $13,655, which is $1,000 more than the national average for spending per K-12 student. To compare, the average cost of in-state tuition for four-year colleges in Ohio is <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.collegecalc.org/colleges/ohio/">$16,045</a>. Parents of toddlers are spending almost as much to send their children to school as are parents of college students. Universal Pre-K would put more money into the pockets of working parents and reduce stress associated with childcare affordability.</p>
