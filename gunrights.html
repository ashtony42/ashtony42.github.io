                            <p>SYG is a solution that is looking for a problem. Traditional self-defense laws protect gun owners in situations in which use of a firearm is necessary; <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/04/953405793/ohio-governor-signs-stand-your-ground-law-after-suggesting-hed-veto-it">SYG not only gives permission to use deadly force when it is avoidable but makes prevention and prosecution of gun violence more difficult</a>.</p>

                            <p>SYG laws consistently result in <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/stand-your-ground-laws-are-a-license-to-kill/#key-findings">growths</a> in total numbers of firearm related deaths, including a 7% increase in suburban counties and an 8% increase in urban counties within state who have adopted them.</p>

                            <p>Nationally, gun crimes committed by white shooters against people of color are 250% more likely to be considered justified than those committed against white victims by POC. In SYG states, that rate jumps to <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/is-there-racial-bias-in-stand-your-ground-laws/">354%</a>. </p>

                            <p>While they aren't a cure-all for gun violence, evidence shows that states with red flag laws have seen <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/red-flag-laws-could-reduce-gun-violence-not-how-some-n1040921">drops in suicide rates</a>.</p>
