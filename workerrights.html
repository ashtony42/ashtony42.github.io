                            <p>Ohio's workers deserve a $15 minimum wage. Because we have put off raising our minimum wage since 2006, to many this sounds impossibly high but in reality this is a compromise. Between 1979 and 2018, net productivity by America's working class <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/">grew</a> by almost 70%. If one were to factor this and inflation both in, the federal minimum wage should be <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://cepr.net/this-is-what-minimum-wage-would-be-if-it-kept-pace-with-productivity/">$24/hour</a>.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In that same period, workers' wages grew by only 11% and the federal corporate tax rates have also <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/04/six-charts-that-show-how-low-corporate-tax-revenues-are-in-the-united-states-right-now">fallen</a> by over 30%.</p>

                            <p>In an effort to attract businesses back to Ohio as part of a $1 billion spending package, Governor DeWine recently approved a <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/gov-mike-dewines-budget-plan-would-spend-1-billion-on-coronavirus-recovery.html">$50 million ad campaign</a> in outside states flaunting our 0% state corporate tax rate while doing nothing to improve conditions for Ohio's workers, addressing increased housing insecurity associated with the pandemic, or providing assistance to those with medical bills associated with COVID-19.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Under Ohio's <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.fiscaltiger.com/is-ohio-a-right-to-work-state/">current At-Will Employment laws</a>, employers are legally allowed to terminate employees for any or no reason. This undermines the financial security and dignity of all workers and can unfairly target those most active in unions.</p>

                            <p>Despite vocal support for Right-to-Work laws in recent years, Ohio has done a good job of preventing their passage. Union workers in states with RTW laws <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.ohea.org/right-to-work/">statistically</a> make less money and receive fewer insurance and pension benefits than those without, so we must continue to fight against them here.</p>
