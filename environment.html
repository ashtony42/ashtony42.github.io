                            <p>Fracking involves injecting large quantities of chemicals directly into the earth to extract oil and natural gases within, a process with <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://environmentamerica.org/sites/environment/files/exp/reports/costs_of_fracking.html">many environmental consequences</a>, including contamination of drinking water, which has a reversal process that been deemed too costly to implement.</p>

                            <p>In 2016, Ohio's Secretary of State (now Lieutenant Governor) Jon Husted <a class="trad_link" target="_blank" href="https://energynews.us/2016/09/15/midwest/ohio-supreme-court-keeps-anti-fracking-measures-off-ballot/">threw out ballot measures</a> in Athens, Meigs, and Portage counties that would have banned fracking locally had they been approved by voters. Not only is this an environmentally dangerous decision, it was an act by our state government that undermined Ohioans' rights to self-govern. </p>

                            <p>Algae blooms, which were once a rare occurrence, are now regularly expected due to pollutants from fertilizer and manure runoff from farmland.</p>
