                        I was born in Fostoria, Ohio. My father, Jim, is the owner of a trucking business and my mom, Beth Ann, has been employed as a United Auto Worker for 35 years. I am also one of three children; I have an older sister, Heather, who lost her twin, Heidi, when I was three years old due to an accident involving a drunk driver. This loss combined with my parents' lifelong work within the blue-collar sector has made me and my family no strangers to both economic and personal challenges.

                    <p>
                        I attended the Lakota Local School District through my entire K-12 academic career and was my class president for all four years of High School. My district was one of Ohio's lowest funded school systems during my childhood, as well as one of our state's most rural.It was here where I saw firsthand how badly income inequality disproportionately impacts rural communities, and how an Ohioan's birth zip code can determine much in terms of employment and fiscal opportunities they are offered throughout their upbringing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from High School in 2009, I moved to Bowling Green, Ohio to attend Bowling Green State University. I focused my studies around Environmental Science while simultaneously working several jobs to support myself while in school, primarily low wage, service-focused positions for a small business owner with two successful restaraunts that had been family owned and operated for over four decades. This experience showed me how much public policy can have drastic impacts on small business owners.

                        While in school, I also found time to dedicate toward serving communities in and around campus, including the LGBTQ+ community. I am an alumni brother of Delta Lambda Phi, the largest social and service fraternity dedicated to gay, bisexual, and trans men in the nation. As secretary of the Beta Omicron chapter at BGSU, I helped to oversee fundraisers for LGBTQ+ affirming causes, including The Trevor Project, a national hotline for LGBTQ+ individuals struggling with self-harm and suicide.

                        Recognizing the increased challenges of balancing costs of education, food on the table, and housing, I made the choice to leave the university before completing my degree and to Columbus to pursue opportunities that are simply not available in northwest Ohio.I now live in Galloway with my husband, Michael, and our two dogs, Luna and Teddy, and I have been proud to call Central Ohio my home for nearly a decade.In that time, I have become involved in causes at multiple community and professional levels, and I am currently in the home stretch of earning my degree in Paralegal Studies from Columbus State College, which I hope to use toward establishing a more equitable community for all Ohioans.

                        <li>
                            <p>We can shift Ohio to 100% renewable energy by 2030 through investments in solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy sources.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>This will create jobs​ that will offset those the Midwest has lost by failing, outdated energy industries (such as coal and fracking), similar to those created by historic public works projects, such as the construction of the interstate highway and transcontinental railroad systems.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Shift investments into public transportation projects, including a high-speed rail system.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>As the central hub of travel between both coasts, Canada, and the South, this would help both to reduce our carbon footprint and to encourage tourist travel within, not just through, Ohio.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Ban Fracking</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Fracking involves injecting large quantities of chemicals directly into the earth to extract oil and natural gases within, a process with many environmental consequences, including contamination of drinking water, which has a reversal process that been deemed too costly to implement.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 2016, Ohio's Secretary of State (now Lieutenant Governor) Jon Husted threw out ballot measures in Athens, Meigs, and Portage counties that would have banned fracking locally had they been approved by voters. Not only is this an environmentally dangerous decision, it was an act by our state government that undermined Ohioans' rights to self-govern. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Lake Erie is the most polluted of the Great Lakes, which are the largest source of fresh water in the entire world.</p>

                            <p>Algae blooms, which were once a rare occurrence, are now regularly expected due to pollutants from fertilizer and manure runoff from farmland.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>We can encourage the agricultural industry to cut back on environmentally harmful practices through small changes such as tax incentives for small, family-run farms, farmers who utilize phosphorus-free fertilizers, and property owners who install rain collection barrels</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>People of color face disproportionately harsher sentencing than their white counterparts.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>There is very little evidence to show that the death penalty reduces rates of violent crime</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>It is estimated that 1 out of 25 people on death row are innocent of the crimes for which they have been convicted. As of Oct. 2020, that works out to be approximately 103 people nationwide.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ohio judges have historically released more people from death row than have gone on to be executed. This causes undue psychological harm to those wrongly convicted and unnecessary strain and costs on our courts.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>End cash bail and for-profit prisons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Cash bail inherently contributes to class inequality within our criminal justice system by imposing harsher punishments on the poor, usually before the accused is even found guilty of a crime.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The bail bonds lobby contributes millions of dollars to campaigns against bail reform bills, which are aimed at lessening the economic burdens on both poor offenders and taxpayers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>For-profit prisons encourage overinflated rates of incarceration by placing quotas on numbers of inmates within their facilities at a given time.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Decriminalize the Cultivation, Sale, Possession, and Consumption of Marijuana</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 2018, 663,000 Americans were arrested on marijuana-related charges. Of those, 609,000 were for possession ALONE. Decriminalization must be paired with blanket expungement for all non-violent offenders' past and current charges. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>The war on drugs overall has affected black and brown communities at far higher rates than white communities despite nearly exact same rates of drug use between them.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>States that have legal marijuana industries have been able to appropriate extra funding from marijuana sales taxes into programs that directly benefit their citizens, including schools.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>Require State Licensure for Law Enforcement</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>The average lawyer takes seven years of higher education to learn the law, while Ohio requires only a high school diploma or GED and less than 800 hours of classroom training and for our police officers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Statistics show that police who hold four year degrees are less likely to face disciplinary action on the job. By requiring a licensure in the areas of human services, social work, or an equivalent social sciences program, we better equip police with the tools needed for successful de-escalation, empathetic service, and the ability to better identify what level of intervention is required for individual situations.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Police should not be equipped with the same weapons of war that we supply to our national armed forces. We need demilitarize the police and shift that funding toward incentivizing higher education for law enforcement officials in order to better serve their communities.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Reinforce Programs to Strengthen Police Accountability</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Information on law enforcement misconduct is considered public in Ohio. We must create an easily accessible and searchable state registry of all police misconduct that does not require a freedom of information request.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>There is currently no statewide law requiring the use of police body cameras. We must require them and impose disciplinary action on any officer found to have removed or turned theirs off while on the job.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>To prevent the unlawful violation of Ohioans' rights to free speech and assembly, we must legally define the term rioting and put an end to the senseless arrests of nonviolent protestors. </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>States with automatic voter registration have seen an uptick in voter turnout following their program rollouts. Ohio should automatically register every eligible voter when they obtain/update a driver's license or state ID.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ohio's "Use It or Lose It" law automatically purges the registration of any voter who does not vote twice in within six years. This is antidemocratic, disproportionately affects lower-income voters, and needs to end. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia offer same day voter registration. Ohio currently has a deadline of four week prior to any election for eligible registration. This is unnecessary and discourages voter participation.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ranked choice voting allows for voters to be more selective about choosing candidates by allowing them to rank them in order of most to least preferred on the ballot. Only one other state (Maine) currently has enacted this system statewide, but Ohio should be the second.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Securing access to absentee and mail-in voting</h3>
                    <ul>

                            <p>In the midst of the pandemic and ahead of the 2020 election, Ohio's Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered the removal of ballot drop boxes throughout the state and limited them solely to county boards of elections. This arbitrary decision faced many court challenges yet still forced thousands of absentee voters in larger counties like Franklin to drive extreme distances just to make sure their vote was cast. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>All regular polling locations should also be fitted with accessible and secure ballot drop-off sites to ensure those without the means to travel have their voices heard.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ohio does not provide postage for absentee ballots. This causes undue burden on voters and can lead to votes not being properly cast.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Ohio is one of the most gerrymandered states in America, largely due to hyper partisan redistricting committees which have gone before the District and Supreme Courts numerous times.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>We must ensure that the bipartisan guidelines for redistricting as voted for by Ohioans in 2018 are respected leading up to, during, and following the 2022 election cycle.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>The Larry Householder scandal and House Bill 6 illustrated the power that corporate donors and lobbyists have over those in our state's government. We must ban direct corporate donations to political campaigns and PACs.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Bribery and back-room dealings in our statehouse cannot be tolerated. Any state legislator who is found to have involvement with corruption, from first term state reps all the way up to the governor, should immediately be up for removal from office by statehouse vote. </p>

                            <p>The Supreme Court ruled in July 2020 that discrimination of the basis of sexual or gender identity in housing or employment is unconstitutional.

                            <p>We must also pass the Ohio Equality Act to expand these protections to include housing, education, and healthcare in the wake of recent federal decisions that have undermined these rights, particularly for transgender Americans.</p>

                    <h3>Protecting worker's right to a decent wage</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Ohio's workers deserve a $15 minimum wage. Because we have put off raising our minimum wage since 2006, to many this sounds impossibly high but in reality this is a compromise. Between 1979 and 2018, net productivity by America's working class grew by almost 70%. If one were to factor this and inflation both in, the federal minimum wage should be $24/hour.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In that same period, workers' wages grew by only 11% and the federal corporate tax rates have also fallen by over 30%.</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Ohio's 0% corporate tax rate places the burden of paying for public services such as education and infrastructure directly onto the taxpayer. This means that Ohioans working minimum wage jobs are paying more in state income taxes than companies with profits in the billions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In an effort to attract businesses back to Ohio as part of a $1 billion spending package, Governor DeWine recently approved a $50 million ad campaign in outside states flaunting our 0% state corporate tax rate while doing nothing to improve conditions for Ohio's workers, addressing increased housing insecurity associated with the pandemic, or providing assistance to those with medical bills associated with COVID-19.</p>
