                        I was born in Fostoria, Ohio. My father, Jim, is the owner of a trucking business and my mom, Beth Ann, has been employed as a United Auto Worker for 35 years. I am also one of three children; I have an older sister, Heather, who lost her twin, Heidi, when I was three years old due to an accident involving a drunk driver. This loss combined with my parents' lifelong work within the blue-collar sector has made me and my family no strangers to both economic and personal challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I attended the Lakota Local School District through my entire K-12 academic career and was my class president for all four years of High School. My district was one of Ohio's lowest funded school systems during my childhood, as well as one of our state's most rural.It was here where I saw firsthand how badly income inequality disproportionately impacts rural communities, and how an Ohioan's birth zip code can determine much in terms of employment and fiscal opportunities they are offered throughout their upbringing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduating from High School in 2009, I moved to Bowling Green, Ohio to attend Bowling Green State University. I focused my studies around Environmental Science while simultaneously working several jobs to support myself while in school, primarily low wage, service-focused positions for a small business owner with two successful restaraunts that had been family owned and operated for over four decades. This experience showed me how much public policy can have drastic impacts on small business owners.

                        While in school, I also found time to dedicate toward serving communities in and around campus, including the LGBTQ+ community. I am an alumni brother of Delta Lambda Phi, the largest social and service fraternity dedicated to gay, bisexual, and trans men in the nation. As secretary of the Beta Omicron chapter at BGSU, I helped to oversee fundraisers for LGBTQ+ affirming causes, including The Trevor Project, a national hotline for LGBTQ+ individuals struggling with self-harm and suicide.

                    <p>
                        Recognizing the increased challenges of balancing costs of education, food on the table, and housing, I made the choice to leave the university before completing my degree and to Columbus to pursue opportunities that are simply not available in northwest Ohio.I now live in Galloway with my husband, Michael, and our two dogs, Luna and Teddy, and I have been proud to call Central Ohio my home for nearly a decade.In that time, I have become involved in causes at multiple community and professional levels, and I am currently in the home stretch of earning my degree in Paralegal Studies from Columbus State College, which I hope to use toward establishing a more equitable community for all Ohioans.
